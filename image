<!-- Description of the dish -->
    <p>Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or
 boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub (bush)

 <!-- Describe what the dish should look, smell and taste like -->
    <p>But there are more ways to describe tea than using just words
 like “yum,” “mmmm,” and “ahhh.” The tea that you taste can be described as 
sour and sweet to spicy and earthy. Most teas matches its description like Creamy 
Caramel or Sweet Lemon,
 which makes it easy to identify the taste before even tasting it</p>
